# About

SimpleBox Object Oriented (SBoo) is the latest version of SimpleBox programmed in R. SimpleBox is a multimedia mass balance model of the so-called ‘Mackay type’ (also called "box models"). More information can be found on the [RIVM website](https://www.rivm.nl/simplebox "simplebox") and in the data and scripts repository: [rivm-syso/SBooScripts](https://github.com/rivm-syso/SBooScripts "SBooScripts").

# Installation

SBoo works with the data supplied in SBooScripts. Both sets of files need to be available in the same parent directory. The preferred approach is creating two R projects in R-Studio. Take care that sometimes there are breaking changes between SBooScripts and SBoo, meaning you need the correct branch (e.g. main with main or development with development in both repositories).

# Usage

SBoo is used from within the SBooScripts R project by initializing for a specific substance type. See for further getting started in SBooScripts: [SBooScripts/vignettes/Getting-started.md](https://github.com/rivm-syso/SBooScripts/blob/development/vignettes/Getting-started.md "getting started").
