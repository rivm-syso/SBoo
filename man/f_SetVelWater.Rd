\title{Function for calculating the Settling Velocity of a particle through water}
\usage{
f_SetVelWater(radius, rhoParticle, rhoWater, DynViscWaterStandard)
}
\arguments{
\item{radius}{Radius of the particle [m]}

\item{rhoParticle}{Density of particle [kg/m3]}

\item{rhoWater}{Density of fluid matrix in which particle is present [kg/m3]}

\item{DynViscWaterStandard}{Dynamic viscosity of water []}

\item{GN}{gravitational force constabt [m2/s]}
}
\value{
f_SetVelWater
}
\description{
Settling Velocity or terminal Velocity of particles in a fluid medium based on Stokes' theorem (1901)
NB SettlingVelocity is a function to be used for all types of partical species, not just nano-species. Therefor it's not a variable defining function.
