# About

SimpleBox Object Oriented (SBoo) is the latest version of SimpleBox
programmed in R. SimpleBox is a multimedia mass balance model of the
so-called ‘Mackay type’ (also called “box models”). More information can
be found on the [RIVM
website](https://www.rivm.nl/simplebox "simplebox") and in the data and
scripts repository:
[rivm-syso/SBooScripts](https://github.com/rivm-syso/SBooScripts "SBooScripts").

# Installation

SBoo works with the data supplied in SBooScripts. Both sets of files
need to be available in the same parent directory. The preferred
approach is creating two R projects in R-Studio. Take care that
sometimes there are breaking changes between SBooScripts and SBoo,
meaning you need to correct branch (e.g. main with main or development
with development in both repositories).

# Usage

SBoo is used from within the SBooScripts R project by initializing for a
specific substance type. See for further getting started in SBooScripts:
[SBooScripts/vignettes/Getting-started.md](https://github.com/rivm-syso/SBooScripts/vignettes/Getting-started.md "getting started").
